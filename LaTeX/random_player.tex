\subsection{The Random Player}
In order to begin our training set, we built our random player.
Much to be expected, this quaint little model wasn't very powerful.
In a 1000 games, while playing itself, the X mark only won about 60\% of the time.
The X mark always has the advantage due to having the first move, thus these results were not promising, though expected.
