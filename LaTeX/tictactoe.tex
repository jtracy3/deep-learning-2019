% TicTacToe Game

Tic-tac-toe is a childhood favorite.
Canvas any elementary school and you're likely to come across at least one, if not
multiple, tic-tac-toe boards etched on the sidewalks in chalk;
at least when I was a kid.
According to Wikipedia, tic-tac-toe can be traced back to Ancient Egypt where game boards can be seen etched into roofs.
Seems like an odd place to play tic-tac-toe.
Regardless, tic-tac-toe has been around to a very long time.
Its simple gameplay makes it a great choice for an introduction into deep learning for games.

When we instantiate our game we create a 3x3 array of empty strings.
Players are mapped using a dictionary for whether they are the first (X) or second (O) player.
Row and column inputs from a human or model agent determine the moves that are recorded into the 3x3 array.
After each move, the remaining spots on the board are saved as possible actions, and our check winner method determines if a player has won the game after their turn.
