% TicTacToe Game

Tic-tac-toe is a childhood favorite.
Canvas any elementary school and you're likely to come across at least one, if not
multiple, tic-tac-toe boards etched on the sidewalks in chalk;
at least when I was a kid.
According to Wikipedia, tic-tac-toe can be traced back to Ancient Egypt where game boards can be seen etched into roofs.
Seems like an odd place to play tic-tac-toe.
Regardless, tic-tac-toe has been around to a very long time.
Its simple gameplay makes it a great choice for an introduction into deep learning for games.

When we instantiate our game we create a 3x3 array of empty strings.
Players are mapped with a dictionary for whether they're the first or second player.
Moves are determined use row and column inputs into the 3x3 array.
After each move, the remaining spots on the board are saved as possible actions.
Futhermore, our check winner method determines if a player has won the game after their turn.
