At first it was a little surprising that the models performed very similarly. After some thought, it seems to make more sense. Sometimes choosing the more advanced method doesn't yield superior results. Tic tac toe is obviously a simple game with simple rules and relatively few board states, and thus Charmeleon was well equipped to handle the task. Futhermore, the dense network was quite a bit deeper than the convolution network which also may have worked in it's favor.  

Based on the results of the agent vs. human, both of these networks are still pretty dumb. They could have really benefited from self play and the advantages of Monte Carlo Tree Search. Implementing AlphaZero was much more difficult than we all anticipated even on a simple game like tic tac toe.  Reinforcement learning is an exciting growing discipline within deep learning, and though we didn't really implement reinforcement learning we learned a lot through this project.
