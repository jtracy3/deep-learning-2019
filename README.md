# Tic Tac Toe
Repository for our Tic Tac Toe project. The goal is to create a Tic Tac Toe AI using Deep Leaning that
will beat even the best Tic Tac Toe savants.

## Workflow
In order to keep the `master` branch clean with only the most up to date code, as well as peer-reviewed code,
each one of us should create a branch to work on our individual pieces. You can do this by going into your
terminal and typing `git checkout -b <name>` while in the `master` branch. From here you'll work as usual,
committing and pushing to your branch. Once you're ready to have your changes merged into `master` create
a pull request. At this point at least one of us should review/understand the incoming code.
